## Digital Poems

### All You Hold

- Simple JavaScript poem randomly selects emojis from two arrays
- Updates at a 4000 ms interval to replace the emojis in the poem's line "If all you hold is a \_**\_, everything looks like a \_\_**"

### Form

- Writing by Andy Weaver
- Programming by Dani Spinosa
- Pressing a button randomly adds a line from a prewritten array, formatted according to selected font typefaces and sizes
- Poem expands indefinitely based on button presses

### When

- Co-written with Andy Weaver and a crowd-sourced lexicon
- On each render, poem replaces words in Weaver's original with poems in arrays divided by position
- Each render is different with Chat GPT telling me there are 14,016,852,913,029,120,000,000 (14 septillion) possible variations of the poem
