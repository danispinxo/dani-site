          “I'm so glad this book exists—for what it means not only to me to read
          it now, but for what it will mean to others who are looking for a way
          into vispo that speaks to them and their lives. I love that it exists
          for the people who are going to be totally blown away by Spinosa and
          Siklosi's conversation, having never read anything quite like that
          before. This book is a real gift to vispo, its fans and present and
          future practitioners.”

          <br />
          <br />
          “Dani Spinosa's latest book of poetry is a collection of glosas that
          is conceptually radical, formally daring, and stylistically
          wonderful—as smart and imaginative as anything one should by now
          expect of Spinosa.”{" "}
          <strong>
            Clayton Longstaff, <em>Canadian Literature</em>{" "}

        </p>

        <p class="has-small-font-size">
          “The fifty typewriter poems in this volume are both thought provoking
          and beautifully crafted.”{" "}
          <strong>
            Jill Mandrake, <em>GEIST</em>
          </strong>
        </p>

        <p class="has-small-font-size">
          “This collection is both Spinosa's personal study in the history of
          visual and concrete poetry as well as a collection of original works…
          She's clearly done her research, and if one were even to put together
          an anthology of or essay on the history of concrete and visual
          poetries, this would be the list of names included. Or, given
          Spinosa's deliberate inclusion of these multiple women practitioners,
          this is the list of names that should be included; and hopefully, in
          part through Spinosa's work, a list of names that will no longer be
          overlooked.” <strong>rob mclennan</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          “Because the glosa, which builds a highly structured rhyming poem
          around a seed quatrain from a source text, is firmly rooted in the
          lyric, Spinosa has to find other ways to both quote and write through
          or around or over her sources. As she acknowledges in the
          introduction, even quoting a line from a concrete poem, much less an
          entire quatrain, can prove difficult as visual forms tend to challenge
          the convention of the line, but she more than manages this feat. The
          poems in the collection capture the aesthetics, the feel, of the texts
          they reference. Perhaps more importantly though, Spinosa's
          intervention in those texts unifies them.&nbsp;<em>OO</em>&nbsp;reads
          as a collection not an anthology with its poet, in the spirit of the
          glosa, paying tribute to influences and inspiration.”{" "}
          <strong>Ryan J. Cox, Prairie Fire</strong>
        </p>

        <p class="has-small-font-size">
          “Dani Spinosa's OO pushes buttons, turns keys, and swipes, steals and
          homages all over poetry. Every poem demands you LOOK AGAIN! and see
          where voices slip between the keystrokes. Extravagant, interruptive,
          declarative and a real kick in the eyeballs.”{" "}
          <strong>derek beaulieu</strong>
        </p>

        <p class="has-small-font-size">
          “WTF does Dani Spinosa think she is doing copying all these (mostly)
          male poets? Lock up your typewriters! Hide your anthologies of classic
          visual poetry! Protect yourself and the literary tradition from the
          stealth interventions of Spinosa, who is (mis)appropriating works by
          every conceivable author of graphically scored verse in the name of
          some kind of femmeship that involves conversations with the dead as
          well as the living. The former are silent on the matter and the
          latter? We shall see. Rarely has mimicry been used to such high-level
          hermeneutic ends.” <strong>Johanna Drucker</strong>
        </p>

        <p class="has-small-font-size">
          “Not only an excellent, well-researched overview of the history and
          tradition of typewritten visual poetry, but also—what a sly female
          response to it!” <strong>Petra Schulze-Wollgast</strong>
